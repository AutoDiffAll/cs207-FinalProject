    "\n",
    "It goes without saying that taking derivatives is an essential operation in numerical methods, optimization, and science. From a computational perspective, however, calculating a derivative can be a difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one uses **finite differences** (i.e. $f'(x) \\approx (f(x+\\epsilon) - f(x))/\\epsilon)$), one needs to choose $\\epsilon$ appropriately. If $\\epsilon$ is too large, the approximation is poor. If $\\epsilon$ is too small, one introduces round-off errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if one uses **symbolic differentiation** (i.e. an algorithm that produces the derivative as a symbolic function), the problem becomes computationally infeasible when you either have functions with many inputs or want to take high order derivatives. These two scenarios occur often in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic differentiation** overcomes these challenges by providing both quick and accurate derivatives."

    "the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation computes derivatives recursively using the chain rule. All functions are either an **\"elementary\" function**, for which we know the derivative, or a composition of elementary functions. To calculate the derivative of a composite function $f(g(x))$, we apply the chain rule as follows:\n",

    "This is in fact a simple example of **forward-mode** automatic differentiation. In general, to conduct forward mode automatic differentiation, we represent our function to differentiate as a **computational graph**. The computational graph  captures the inputs and outputs of our elementary functions. In an example that can be found [here](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/), we can represent $f(x,y)=\\cos(x)\\sin(y)+\\frac{x}{y}$ as \n",

    "\n",
    "By computing derivatives recursively using the chain rule from the inputs $x$ and $y$ to the output $f$, we can calculate the derivative over the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will implement only forward-mode automatic differentiation, but as an aside, **reverse-mode automatic differentiation** begins at the output(s) of the computational graph and calculates derivates using the chain rule by traversing the graph backwards."

Note that the user has to specify the variable name when they instantiate their Variable instances. This is necessary in order to keep track of the various partial derivatives for multivariable functions.\n",

    "`Variable.name`: name of the variable. When the user first instantiates a `Variable` instance, it is important that the user sets the name of the variable. This is necessary to keep track of the various variables while we calculate compound functions. Importantly, this will allow us to calculate the partial derivatives with respect to each of the instantiated `Variable` instances correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Variable.val`: value of the variables. The shape is the same as the input variable. \n",

    "* Methods\n",
    "\n",

    "The two main methods that the user will typically use are `Variable.jacobian()` and `Variabel.partial_der(x)`.

    "\n",
    ">For example, we will override the `np.sin` function such that if you use it on an `variable` instance `x` at a given value, it will return another `variable` instance with the value of $\\sin(x)$, and the calculated derivative of $\\dot{x}\\cos(x)$ at the given value. Similarly, we will override the `np.exp` function such that if you use it on an `variable` instance `x` at a given value, it will return another `variable` instance with the value of $\\exp(x)$, and the calculated derivative of $\\dot{x}\\exp(x)$ at the given value.\n",
